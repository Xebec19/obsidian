## Introduction to webdevelopment and overview of HTML and CSS

  

In this session we covered how webpages are fetched and basic examples of HTML and CSS

  

### Browsing the web

  

First we discussed how we perform a search

As we search for www.google.com in our browser. The query is sent to ISP (Internet Service Provider) which looks for the query in DNS (Domain Name Service). ISP are large organizations which provides internet to users like us.

DNS (Domain Name Service) is a registry which maps domain name to IP Address. IP Address is a unique address given to each computer over internet.

Back to searching, After ISP finds the required resource in DNS, it sends us back the IP Address of that resource or server. The resource then sends us the html, css and javascript files which we execute in our browser and a web page is displayed on our browser.

  

You can read more about ISP [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-service-provider-isp-hierarchy/)

  

Once we get the IP Address, we are able to directly connect to that server

How are we able to connect to that server ? Please refer to following diagram.
